# GridGame

This is going to be a system where my high school computer science students can make games using a grid based system (tic tac toe, game of life, snake, etc.) without having to spend a lot of time learning (and debugging) graphics.  My goal is for the students to have all of their game logic in one class (or multiple if it makes sense), and they won't have to edit any other classes (though I might have to beforehand).

This is a very alpha version.
